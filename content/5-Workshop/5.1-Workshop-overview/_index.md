## 5.1 Overview & Architecture

### 1. Business & Technical Context

Maintaining dedicated cloud servers (like EC2/VPS) 24/7 for student housing software wastes significant funds due to high idle time during non-peak hours (e.g., late nights).

**SmartDorm** solves this inefficiency by adopting an event-driven **Serverless** architecture on AWS, reducing the monthly operational cost to **nearly $0/month** in staging.

### 2. Detailed Staging Network Architecture

The diagram below illustrates the network layout and data lifecycle:

### 3. Service Interactions

- **Vercel:** Hosts Next.js client builds with free HTTPS/SSL certificates.
- **HTTP API Gateway:** Proxies incoming HTTPS requests to the Lambda function. Billed at 70% cheaper than REST API.
- **AWS Lambda:** Processes backend operations serverless. Instantiates micro-VM containers on-demand, billed per millisecond of compute.
- **Amazon S3:** Hosts permanent public file uploads (avatars, ID scans) bypassing Lambda's read-only disk layout.
- **Amazon RDS:** Managed PostgreSQL instance deployed in a secure private subnet, reachable only from the Lambda security group boundary.
